# An Addon for Storyteller
This addon for the StoryTeller module adds three single page journal styles, and adds a page style background to the editor.
Note: the Table of Contents is only loaded for the journal owner(s)

In Work (not released yet):

The "custom image" singlesheet style will take the first image page from the journal entry (hide that page) and use it as the background with all other pages as a single scrollable multisheet (if no image pages are found it defaults to "clean" singlesheet background.

The "Scroll (vertical)" template is also a single scrollable multisheet, but in the style of a scroll, rolling up and down.
Known-issue: the scrollbar is invisible, but does function, 1) making it hard to find, and 2) may cause confusion if clicked on accident.
