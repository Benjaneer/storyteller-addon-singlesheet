In Work (not released yet):

The "custom image" singlesheet style will take the first image page from the journal entry (hide that page) and use it as the background with all other pages as a single scrollable multisheet (if no image pages are found it defaults to "pristine" singlesheet background.

The "Scroll (vertical)" template is also a single scrollable multisheet, but in the style of a scroll, rolling up and down.
Images shrink to fit-width and auto-scale height (maintaining aspect ratio of the origional image).
