The "custom image" singlesheet style will take the first image page from the journal entry (hide that page) and use it as the background with all other pages as a single scrollable multisheet (if no image pages are found it defaults to "pristine" singlesheet background.

The "Scroll (vertical)" template is also a single scrollable multisheet, but in the style of a scroll, rolling up and down.
Images shrink to fit-width and auto-scale height (maintaining aspect ratio of the origional image).

"Scroll (horizontal)" is book (two page) width. Images will scale to full height and auto width (maintianing aspect ratio of the origional image).
**Update:** Text pages will be the width of the scroll and will have a vertical scrollbar if their text exceeds the height of the page (which is hidden to the right).
