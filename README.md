# An Addon for Storyteller
This addon for the StoryTeller module adds three single page journal styles, and adds a page style background to the editor.
Note: the Table of Contents is only loaded for the journal owner(s), also to prevent peaking the click to open is disabled on images for worn and ragged styles
